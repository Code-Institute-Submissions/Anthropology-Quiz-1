## Features


### Start Button
* Situated at the top of the game area, this provides the user with a clear and easily identifiable way to start the game.


### Game layout and design

* The background image of cave paintings is in line with the topic of the quiz as well as providing a warm colour without being distracting.
* The green, brown, and purple colours used throughout the website were specifically matched to the background.
* The game area consists of a question container at the top in a green background.
* This is followed by the four answer choices the player is presented with.
* Under the options is a time bar, which gives the user twenty seconds to answer the question.
* Finally, we have the progress tracker, where each circle indicates a question and lights up when the question is answered. Green for correct and red for incorrect.
* The user's score is shown at the end of the twelve questions.



## Testing


* The site has been tested on Google Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.
* It is responsive and works on all standard screen sizes.



## Validator Testing


* HTML no errors found using the official W3C validator.
* CSS no were found using the Jigsaw validator.
* The Javascript code has been tested successfully, aside from a few warnings for undefined and unused variables. This was done on the JSHint website.
